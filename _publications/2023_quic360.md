## Abstract

This paper introduces Query-based Image Captioning (QuIC) for 360-degree images, where a query (words or short phrases) specifies the context to describe. This task is more challenging than conventional image captioning, as it requires fine-grained scene understanding to select content consistent with the user's intent based on the query. We constructed a dataset comprising 3,940 360-degree images and 18,459 pairs of queries and captions annotated manually. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning image captioning models on our dataset can generate more diverse and controllable captions from multiple contexts of 360-degree images.

## Methodology

The proposed QuIC task involves generating captions for 360-degree images based on user-specified queries. We developed a dataset with manually annotated query-caption pairs to facilitate this task. The methodology includes fine-tuning existing image captioning models on this dataset to enable them to produce contextually relevant captions corresponding to the provided queries.

## Experimental Results

Experiments show that models fine-tuned on our dataset can generate more diverse and controllable captions for 360-degree images. The results indicate that the QuIC approach effectively captures multiple contexts within 360-degree imagery, aligning with user-specified queries.

## Key Contributions

- **Introduction of QuIC Task**: We propose the novel task of Query-based Image Captioning for 360-degree images, addressing the challenge of describing specific contexts within panoramic imagery.

- **Dataset Construction**: We created a dataset consisting of 3,940 360-degree images and 18,459 manually annotated query-caption pairs to support research in this area.

- **Model Fine-tuning**: We demonstrate that fine-tuning image captioning models on our dataset enables the generation of diverse and contextually relevant captions based on user queries.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The QuIC task presents a promising direction for enhancing image captioning models to handle user-specified contexts within 360-degree images. Future work may explore the application of QuIC to other types of imagery and investigate more sophisticated models capable of understanding and generating captions for complex scenes.
