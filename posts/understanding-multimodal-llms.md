## The Evolution of Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with AI. But the next frontier is **multimodal understanding** - models that can process both text and images seamlessly.

### Key Challenges

1. **Alignment**: How do we align visual and textual representations?
2. **Scale**: Training multimodal models requires massive computational resources
3. **Evaluation**: How do we measure true understanding vs. pattern matching?

### Recent Breakthroughs

Recent models like GPT-4V and Gemini have shown impressive capabilities in:

- Visual question answering
- Image captioning with context
- Cross-modal reasoning

## What's Next?

The future of AI lies in models that can understand the world the way humans do - through multiple senses and modalities.

Stay tuned for more technical deep dives!
